# README.md

This repo is used to store all the source code of languages and tools I'm interested in.

I'll be adding content on a daily basis and will include simple tasks like "Hello world" programs and step by step guides to build simple programs.

The idea is to include content of the following:
- Clojure
- Erlang
- Elixir
- Git/Github
- Go
- Java
- GraalVM
